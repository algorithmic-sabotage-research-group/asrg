## Context

Based on the work of the Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group (ASRG), Theorizing “Algorithmic Sabotage” is an urgent intervention rooted in the militant liberation struggles of the most oppressed within the arena of global computational racial capitalism, with the aim of creating and defending spaces of autonomy for the development and dissemination of radical and counter-hegemonic social imaginaries through the universal prefigurative techno-politicisation of the class base, for the manifestation of direct, vigorous struggles of combative algorithmic agency and resistance against the hyper-abstracted optimisations and capitalisation of life without limits by the techno-elite regimes, the mathematised processes of alienation and the turn towards to algorithmic fascism.
