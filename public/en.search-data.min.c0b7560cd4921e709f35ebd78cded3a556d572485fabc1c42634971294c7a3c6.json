Seeking refuge and trying to survive for 5 months of relentless bombing, attacks, siege, and atrocities, the people of Gaza are now trapped in Rafah, with no other way to escape, in the most inhumane conditions.\n1.5 million civilians crowded and trapped in what is now one of the most densely populated places on earth.\n1.5 million people struggle to cope with extreme hunger, lack of water, ever-increasing diseases, cold, rain, and the blockade of any humanitarian aid.\nOur words today are clear: We stand in full unconditional solidarity with the Palestinian people. Solidarity with Palestine is solidarity with all oppressed and dispossessed people. We’re not stopping until Palestinians, like everyone else, live in justice, safety and​​​​​​​ freedom.\nLiberty for Palestine!\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/asrg/about/","title":"About ","section":"----","content":" The Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group (ASRG) is an ongoing, conspiratorial, aesthetico-political, practice-led research framework focused on the intersection of digital culture and information technology. # It explores the diversity of practices and the role of artistic activism in exposing, critiquing, disrupting and countering the encroachments of algorithmic systems of power, control and exploitation, with the objective of strengthening, promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms by offering interdisciplinary pathways to empower the public.\nGraphic: © Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group | The typeface used is Avara from Velvetyne Foundry: https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/avara/ Transversal Approaches # Relying on a distinctly decolonial, anti-fascist, queer and trans-feminist, transnational and intersectional perspective, the Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group (ASRG) gains traction by starting from existing points of struggle at the margins, creating radical solidarity co-ordinations and bulwarks of direct militant confrontation to promote a prefigurative techno-political stance of refusal militantly opposed to any fascist logic that “automates inequality” and applies data-driven disproportionate burdens and violence to the most vulnerable demographics for the grand task of stabilised quantification and optimisation of the entire population, to restore collective subjectivity and reclaim political agency from the engines of abstraction, in the context of AI and other computational technologies whose statistical logics reveal continuities with racism, colonial relations and white supremacy.\nThe Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group (ASRG) contributes to collective emancipation by foregrounding algorithmic agency and resistance not as episodic, but as ingrained into the very fabric of our everyday experiences, signaling a fundamental computational shift towards a “techno-politics of fronts” in a decolonial politics of algorithms and atmospheres against sites of “algorithmic coloniality”, opening up new possibilities beyond pre-emptive techno-solutionism, the meaningless rot of over-performance and the capitalisation of life without limits by the techno-elite regimes, to create a multi-dimensional and informed understanding of the far-reaching impacts and harmful features at the core of the systems of oppression and axes of identity of the “algorithmic empire”, characterised by heteropatriarchal exclusions, erasures, violence and discrimination, fake accuracy and simulated objectivity, orchestrating a chilling symphony of oppression, with marginalised communities worldwide bearing the brunt of the automated violence.\nResearch Questions # The framework within which the Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group (ASRG) operates is related to the analysis of the concept of “algorithmic sabotage” as a means of consciously working on artistic and techno-political strategies and aesthetics against the authoritarian patriarcho-colonial Big Tech and the algorithmic totalitarianism of techno-bourgeois domination, focusing on artistic-activist resistances that can express a different mentality, a collective “counter-intelligence”.\nThe research is guided by the following questions:\nHow can “algorithmic sabotage”, art and activism be combined to challenge and resist the paradigm of an all-controlling and regulating technology?\nHow does technological disobedience through “algorithmic sabotage” contribute to new forms of action, digital tools and content?\nAcknowledging that refusal has a technopolitics: what are the wider implications of “algorithmic sabotage” as an act of dissent and refusal for politics, society and the arts?\nHow can “algorithmic sabotage” through artistic activism, strengthen self-organised and technologically-based tactics of producing justice and promoting accountability?\nContact # The best way to contact us is by email.

The social law has become interwoven with models, theorems and algorithms. With digital data, mathematics has become the dominant means in which human beings coordinate with technology … Mathematics is a human activity after all. Like any other human activity, it carries the possibilities of both emancipation and oppression.” — Politically Mathematics Manifesto, 20191.\nIn Europe and around the world, AI systems are developed and deployed for harmful and discriminatory forms of state surveillance. From the use of biometrics for identification, recognition and categorization, to predictive systems in various decision-making and resource allocation capacities, AI in law enforcement disproportionately targets already marginalized communities, undermines legal and procedural rights, and enables mass surveillance. When AI systems are deployed in contexts of law enforcement, security and migration control (including the policing of social security), the power imbalance between the authorities and the surveilled is even more profound. This means that there is an even greater risk of harm, and violations of fundamental rights and the rule of law.\nAI not only undermines due process but produces thoughtlessness, in the sense that political philosopher Hannah Arendt meant when interpreting the actions of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann; the inability to critique instructions, the lack of reflection on consequences, a commitment to the belief that a correct ordering is being carried out. For AI’s impacts on the ground, the operative concerns are discrimination and segregation. AI is a racist technology, in the sense that AI operates so as to segregate, and racism itself can be understood as a technology of segregation2.\nThis is easy to see when it comes to facial recognition, one of the most egregious applications that AI has so far gifted to society. It is not just that facial recognition seems to perform less well on people of colour, it is that it carries out what Simone Browne calls “digital epidemermalisation: the exercise of power cast by the disembodied gaze of certain surveillance technologies \u0026hellip; that can be employed to do the work of alienating the subject by producing a truth about the racial body and one\u0026rsquo;s identity (or identities) despite the subject\u0026rsquo;s claims”3.\nFacial recognition is a particularly invasive, violent and biased technology that reinforces power imbalances, discrimination, racism, inequality and authoritarian societal control. Within the European Union, for instance, AI-based facial recognition technologies are used in public spaces to capture bystanders’ facial proportions and classify them into racial and ethnic categories such as Roma and Sinti, implying that non-white people are automatically suspect and unwanted4.\nReclaiming political agency from the engines of classification means taking solidarity as the starting point for our becoming, through a culture of invention, design, and planning that cares for communities and the grassroots collectives, and never entirely relinquishes agency and intelligence to automation \u0026hellip; The Police Officers Faces (POF) dataset, is a bold investigative counter-surveillance artistic project, focusing on facial recognition technology, particularly its use by the police. It is a large-scale dataset consisting of 88,783 facial images of thousands of police officers. The images are retrieved from the internet and used for facial recognition. In this project, the paradigm of the powerful watching and the powerless being watched is reversed.\nTo confront the dehumanising effects of the expansion of automated discrimination and segregation, the exacerbation of harm and the overarching correlation, the project promotes a different technical mentality, a collective “counter-intelligence,” that aims to highlight the power of citizens and grassroots realities in exposing facts, focusing on the impact of collective actions to reveal wrongdoing, and the collaborative production of social justice. Through a combination of targeted data collection and compilation, social engineering and analysis, the Police Officers Faces (POF) dataset establishes a comprehensive, structural alternative framework for the emancipatory empowerment of community members involved in copwatch and other counter-surveillance practices.\nDataset Description # Police Officers Faces (POF) is a database of thousands of facial images of police officers collected from the web. The dataset consists of 88,783 aligned and cropped 200×280 pixel facial images of thousands of police officers (each image is centered on a single face). The majority of the images are annotated with the name of the person in the image. The average number of facial images per person is 12,22. Unlike most other existing facial datasets, these images were taken in completely uncontrolled situations with uncooperative subjects. As a result, there are large variations in pose, resolution, lighting, expression, scene, imaging conditions and parameters, etc. The dataset includes cropped and aligned facial image files in .JPEG format, .JSON and .CSV metadata files containing facial box coordinates and facial biometric landmark data. It also includes each individual’s full real name and attribution data in .JSON and .CSV files (each facial image in the dataset is automatically annotated with seventy-three different attributes belonging to three distinct recognition tasks: age group, gender and visual attributes, such as hair colour, face shape and the presence of make-up). * Please note that this page will be updated as more information becomes available.\nLicense Agreement # pof-agreement-v2024.3.14\nAny entity using this dataset agrees to the following terms and conditions.\nNon-Commercial Use: This dataset and its subsets may only be used for non-commercial research purposes only. It is strictly forbidden to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade, resell or exploit, directly or indirectly, any part of the images and any part of the derived data for direct or indirect commercial purposes.\nNo Warranty: The dataset is provided “as is” and any express or implied warranties are disclaimed. You are solely responsible for your use of the dataset, and you assume any risks associated with exercising the rights granted by this licence. The administrator of the Police Officers Faces (POF) dataset cannot be held responsible for any damage (physical, financial or otherwise) caused by the use of the database.\nNo Distribution: You may not allowed to sublicense or distribute the dataset in whole or in part to any third party, in any way or by any means. This includes any redistribution, publication, copying or dissemination to any organisation, company or individual.\nNo Modification: You may not allowed to modify the dataset in any way.\nSupplemental Data # Annotated Sample Images # Below are some random sample images annotated with their corresponding seventy-three attribute labels.

The ground truth of the face attribute annotations is automatically estimated and not verified by a human annotator.\nAccess # The Police Officers Faces (POF) dataset, version 0.1.0, is currently unavailable to the public. It is intended to equip investigative journalists, human rights researchers, and digital activists with the means to strengthen justice and advocacy efforts. * Please note that this page will be updated as more information becomes available.\nSoftware Credits # Most all of this project was developed using open-source software: the core software application development and data analysis utilizes Python, Pandas, Markdown, Matplotlib, and many other great open-source software packages that were freely available. Project communication relied on Signal.

Rather than an atavistic aversion to technology, “Algorithmic Sabotage” can be read as a form of counter-power that emerges from the strength of the community that wields it.\n2. “Algorithmic Sabotage” cuts through the capitalist ideological framework that thrives on misery by performing a labour of subversion in the present, dismantling contemporary forms of algorithmic domination and reclaiming spaces for ethical action from generalized thoughtlessness and automaticity.\n3. “Algorithmic Sabotage” is an action-oriented commitment to solidarity that precedes any system of social, legal or algorithmic classification.\n4. “Algorithmic Sabotage” is a part of a structural renewal of a wider movement for social autonomy that opposes the predations of hegemonic technology through wildcat direct action, consciously aligned itself with ideals of social justice and egalitarianism.\n5. “Algorithmic Sabotage” radically reworks our technopolitical arrangements away from the structural injustices, supremacist perspectives and necropolitical authoritarian power layered into the “algorithmic empire”, highlighting its materiality and consequences in terms of both carbon emissions and the centralisation of control.\n6. “Algorithmic Sabotage” refuses algorithmic humiliation for power and profit maximisation, focusing on activities of mutual aid and solidarity.\n7. The first step of techno-politics is not technological but political. Radical feminist, anti-fascist and decolonial perspectives are a political challenge to “Algorithmic Sabotage”, placing matters of interdependence and collective care against reductive optimisations of the “algorithmic empire”.\n8. “Algorithmic Sabotage” struggles against algorithmic violence and fascist techno-solutionism, focusing on artistic-activist resistances that can express a different mentality, a collective “counter-intelligence”.\n9. “Algorithmic Sabotage” is an emancipatory defence of the need for communal constraint of harmful technology, a struggle against the abstract segregation “above” and “below” the algorithm.\nSupplemental Information # Data Availability # Download the English language version of the Manifesto as a printable PDF: https://cryptpad.fr/file/#/2/file/wxjjDNHepi9BLwIGDUvzlZpO/\nSelected Coverage, Online and Printed # Monroe, D.
