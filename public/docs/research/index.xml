      <description>Intertwined Feedback Loops A series of intertwined feedback loops that unfold from several interrelated briefs for intellectual and practical exploration. Posted: Jun 13, 2024. Modified: Jun 15, 2024 Context # The Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group (ASRG) has drawn a series of intertwined feedback loops that unfold from several interrelated briefs for intellectual and practical exploration. These critically subversive flowcharts have been informed by research on digital labour exploitation, invisible infrastructures, techno-colonialism, automatised technologies of tracking, monitoring and surveillance and many other contemporary phenomena at the intersection between technology and society.</description>

      <description>Theorizing “Algorithmic Sabotage” An urgent intervention rooted in the militant liberation struggles of the most oppressed within the arena of global computational racial capitalism. Posted: Jun 13, 2024. Modified: Jun 15, 2024 A crowd in San Francisco’s Chinatown surrounded a Waymo robotaxi on Saturday, breaking windows and throwing fireworks inside, setting the vehicle ablaze | Image Source: https://sfstandard.com/2024/02/12/waymo-san-francisco-burned-arrests/ Context # Based on the work of the Algorithmic Sabotage Research Group (ASRG), Theorizing “Algorithmic Sabotage” is an urgent intervention rooted in the militant liberation struggles of the most oppressed within the arena of global computational racial capitalism, with the aim of creating and defending spaces of autonomy for the development and dissemination of radical and counter-hegemonic social imaginaries through the universal prefigurative techno-politicisation of the class base, for the manifestation of direct, vigorous struggles of combative algorithmic agency and resistance against the hyper-abstracted optimisations and capitalisation of life without limits by the techno-elite regimes, the mathematised processes of alienation and the turn towards to algorithmic fascism.</description>
